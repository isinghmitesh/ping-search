# ping search.

once albert enstien said ....."everything should be made as simple as possible,  but not simpler" 
today i present to you the simplest product discovery webapp. 
Our value proposition is:
1> we offer complete search privacy. so you wont see facebook ads of your searches. 
2> if search is specific ...it also works as a price comparison engine (all products in one line)
3> The main feature of this app which differentiates us from the whole product discovery market is Surprise me function  .....which invokes impulsive buying.


Limitations:
1st and 2nd search

future:
inital keyword feed.
price maintinance---on the go
